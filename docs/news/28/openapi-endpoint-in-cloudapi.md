# CloudAPI now supports /openapi.json and /version endpoints

These endpoints are useful for deployment in the cloud.redhat.com platform.
The platform will use data from the /openapi.json endpoint to automatically
generate documentation for the REST API. A user can see the documentation
in the cloud.redhat.com web console.
